                for
                changing careers. I want a better finacial stuation to give them the best life I can. Also why I chose
                Atomic
                over other plans,I needed a learning path that left me plenty of time with my family.</p>

                <p>LAst thing about me... Hmmm... I am a creator, It is in my blood, it is what I love doing. I usually
                    don't care
                    what I am creating as long as I am creating. Imuch prefer creatio to consumption, though Netflix may
                    have some
                    differing oppinions on that, hmm...</p>
